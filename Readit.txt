10 golden rules of PCB design

RULE 1: CHOOSE THE RIGHT GRID-SET AND ALWAYS USE THE GRID SPACING THAT MATCHES THE MOST COMPONENTS. 
RULE 2: KEEP THE PATH SHORTEST AND MOST DIRECT. 
RULE 3: USE THE POWER LAYER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO MANAGE THE DISTRIBUTION OF POWER LINES AND GROUND LINES. 
RULE 4: GROUP RELATED COMPONENTS TOGETHER WITH THE REQUIRED TEST POINTS.
RULE 5: COPY THE REQUIRED CIRCUIT BOARD ON ANOTHER LARGER CIRCUIT BOARD MULTIPLE TIMES FOR PCB IMPOSITION. 
RULE 6: INTEGRATE COMPONENT VALUES.
RULE 7: PERFORM DESIGN RULE CHECKS (DRC) AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
RULE 8: USE SCREEN PRINTING FLEXIBLY.
RULE 9: DECOUPLING CAPACITORS MUST BE SELECTED.
RULE 10: GENERATE PCB MANUFACTURING PARAMETERS AND VERIFY THEM BEFORE SUBMITTING FOR PRODUCTION.
